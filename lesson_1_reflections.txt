How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I never used Google Docs, Dropbox or Git. Just by using Manual Control. But not a good effort. I think Git and Github is one of the best tools to make a better version control.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Commit can be more logistic than Google Docs; Commit can be offline. Cons: Commit may not be saved in time, yet Google Docs could do that.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In my opinion, Git is like a process of a program, yet Google Docs just faces the single documents. So Git is a better tool in version control than Google Docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First, make the command: got log, to find all the logs, then, copy the toppest ID and the last ID by using git diff to view the history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I will not feel afraid about losing data cuz the data will be no change when I change the ID to check different versions. When I wanna go back, just enter the most recently version ID.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Building my website program, and help making another program by my friend!
