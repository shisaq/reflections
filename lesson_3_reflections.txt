When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would say "NOW"!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I'm doing my work, I definitely don't want the code change automatically. I just will pull the changes when I think it's necessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Copy sth from other's Github into my own Github;
Clones: Copy sth from other places into my local;
Branches: Creat a new version based on a stable version, but both of them can be handled by myself.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

1. Keeping updating is a good habit to avoid ignore the latest update; 2. Help avoid the disturb of network; 3. Have more chances to test locally without affecting others.
