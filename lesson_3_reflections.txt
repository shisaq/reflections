When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would say "NOW"!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I'm doing my work, I definitely don't want the code change automatically. I just will pull the changes when I think it's necessary.
